                <h3>Devin Elle Kurtz</h3></a>
                <img  src="img/devin.png" alt="devin elle artwork">
                <p>Devin Inspires me because of her imaginative landscapes. 
                    She uses many saturated colors to emphasize focal points 
                    in her design, which inspires my color palettes. </p>

                    <h3>Crenerit</h3></a>
                <img src="img/crenerit.png" alt="crenerit artwork">
                <p>Crenerit has many simple, unique logos that use clean typefaces 
                    to highlight the product. The products seem modern with the combination
                    of type and log graphics. </p>

                    <h3>Emi</h3></a>
                <img src="img/emi.png" alt=""emi artwork>
                <p>Emi inspires me because of her use of dark screens in her designs. Dark screen 
                    is hard to design with, but she uses color to make the screens stand out.</p>
